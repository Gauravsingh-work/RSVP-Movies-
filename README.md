# Problem Introduction

RSVP Movies is an Indian film production company that has produced many super-hit movies. The company has generally released movies for the Indian audience, but they plan to release a movie for the global audience in 2022.
The production company wants to plan every move analytically based on data and has approached you for help with this new project. You have been provided with the data of the movies that have been released in the past 3 years. You have to analyse the data set and draw meaningful insights to help the company start their new project.
You are a data analyst and an SQL expert. You have to use SQL to analyse the given data and give recommendations to RSVP Movies based on your insights. For your convenience, the analytics process has been divided into four segments, where each segment leads to significant insights from different combinations of tables. The questions in each segment with business objectives are listed in the script below. You have to write the solution code below every question and submit the same SQL script file with the solution in the ‘Submission’ segment.

# Some tips before starting 
Go through the data thoroughly before starting the assignment. It will give you a good sense of what all the columns represent, which is a good practice to follow before proceeding with the analysis. You should download the database script and run it in your local system.
Read through each of the instructions carefully, identify the task to be performed and only then proceed to write the required code. Do not perform any incorrect analysis or look for information that is not needed for the assignment. The solution output should be in the expected format if given in the question.
Try using appropriate aliases for the variable names. Avoid using names like ABC, ABC, etc.
Always try to write optimised codes. Use appropriate tables and joins as per the questions asked.
There are some checkpoints given in the question SQL script provided. Keep your eye out for them as they are useful pieces of information that you can use to check if the result you have obtained after performing a particular task is correct.
